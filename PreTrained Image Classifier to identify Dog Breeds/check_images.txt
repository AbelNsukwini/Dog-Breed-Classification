Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
alexnet: yes
resnet: yes
vgg: yes

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
alexnet: no -> Dog_01.jpg - golden retriever (correct); Dog_02.jpg - tub, vat (false)
resnet: yes
vgg: yes


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
alexnet: yes
resnet: yes
vgg: yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
I would utilize the ResNet in this specific situation. ResNet and VGG both perform better than AlexNet and give the same accuracy. I would employ this architecture to categorize the submitted photographs because the ResNet is a little quicker. Though it might be slower than the other two structures, overall I would choose the VGG architecture because, as shown in the findings, it provides the best accuracy performance.
